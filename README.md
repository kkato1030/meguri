# meguri（巡り）

**Run AI coding agents on a loop — inside your terminal multiplexer, so you can step in anytime.**

meguri is a reimplementation of the ideas in [nexu-io/looper](https://github.com/nexu-io/looper) with one deliberate architectural difference: instead of headless one-shot agent runs (`claude --print …`), meguri runs each agent as a **live interactive session in a [herdr](https://herdr.dev) or tmux pane**. The orchestrator injects prompts and waits for results, while you can attach to the pane at any moment — watch, type extra instructions, answer permission dialogs, or take over completely — without breaking the loop.

## Why interactive sessions?

Headless loops fail opaquely: the agent hits a permission prompt, stalls, or goes down a wrong path, and all you get is a log. In meguri the agent's real TUI is always there:

- **Blocked ≠ failed.** When the agent shows a permission/question dialog, meguri flags the run `awaiting_human` and tells you how to attach — timers stop, nothing is killed.
- **Human input is never an error.** You can attach and type mid-run; the orchestrator only acts on durable signals (the result file, git state, labels), so it tolerates and absorbs your interventions.
- **Silence is nudged, not punished.** A quiet agent gets a capped number of reminder lines, then a human is paged. meguri never auto-fails a run for being slow.
- **Takeover/handback.** `meguri takeover <run>` parks the orchestrator; you drive the same session; `meguri handback <run>` resumes the loop with your work in context.

## The completion contract

meguri never parses the agent's screen to decide success. Each turn writes a prompt file into the worktree and instructs the agent to finish by writing:

```json
// .meguri/result.json
{"turn_id": "<uuid>", "status": "success | failure | needs_human", "summary": "…"}
```

Stale turn ids are ignored; results claiming success are **independently verified** (clean tree, commits ahead of the base branch, project check command passes) before meguri moves on. Verification failures come back to the agent as corrective turns.

## Install & set up

Prereqs: `git`, [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) (authenticated), an agent CLI (`claude` by default), and a multiplexer — a running [herdr](https://herdr.dev) (recommended; native agent-state detection) or `tmux` (screen-heuristic fallback).

```bash
cargo install --path .   # or: cargo build --release
meguri init              # writes ~/.meguri/config.toml, creates the db
meguri doctor            # checks gh auth, mux, agent CLI
```

Register a project in `~/.meguri/config.toml`:

```toml
[[projects]]
id = "myproj"
repo_path = "/abs/path/to/clone"
repo_slug = "owner/repo"
default_branch = "main"
check_command = "cargo test"   # optional but recommended: meguri runs this itself
```

## Use

```bash
# one-shot: work a single issue
meguri run --project myproj --issue 42

# or keep watching: label an issue `meguri:ready` and meguri picks it up
meguri watch

meguri ps                 # runs, interaction state, panes
meguri logs <run>         # event trail + live pane tail
meguri attach <run>       # jump into the agent's pane
meguri pause <run>        # stop injecting prompts; pane stays alive
meguri resume <run>
meguri takeover <run>     # orchestrator hands-off; you drive
meguri handback <run>
meguri stop <run>         # kill pane, release the claim, cancel
```

### Labels

| label | meaning |
|---|---|
| `meguri:ready` | you queue an issue for the worker loop |
| `meguri:working` | meguri claimed it (removed when the PR opens) |
| `meguri:hold` | discovery skips this issue |
| `meguri:needs-human` | meguri gave up; a comment explains why |

Labels and comments on GitHub are the durable workflow state (looper's "Authority" principle); the local sqlite (`~/.meguri/meguri.sqlite`) only tracks run execution. Kill meguri any time — `meguri watch` recovers: live panes are re-adopted, dead runs resume from their last checkpointed step.

## Configuration

See `meguri init` output for the full default `config.toml`. Highlights:

```toml
[mux]
kind = "auto"          # auto | herdr | tmux
session = "meguri"     # herdr workspace label / tmux session name
keep_pane = "on-failure"  # also: always | never

[agent]
command = "claude"
args = []              # e.g. ["--permission-mode", "acceptEdits"]

[limits]
idle_grace_secs = 90        # silence before a nudge
nudge_limit = 2             # nudges before paging a human
max_turn_runtime_secs = 2700
result_grace_secs = 60      # wait for Working→Idle after result appears
validate_turns = 3          # fix attempts for a failing check_command

[scheduler]
poll_interval_secs = 60
max_concurrent_runs = 2
```

## Development

```bash
cargo test                          # unit + tmux integration (skips w/o tmux)
MEGURI_TEST_HERDR=1 cargo test      # + herdr integration (needs live herdr)
```

The test suite drives the full loop with a scripted fake agent TUI (`tests/fixtures/fake_agent.sh`) against real tmux, real git worktrees, and a local bare origin — including blocked-dialog handling, lying-agent correction, validation feedback, and crash recovery.

## Status / roadmap

MVP: the **worker** loop (issue → PR) on GitHub. The architecture mirrors looper's role model, so planner / reviewer / fixer loops are planned as additional `Loop` implementations sharing the same turn engine, with labels extending to `meguri:plan` → `meguri:spec-reviewing` → `meguri:spec-ready`.
